## Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Look at previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure the entry is useful before submitting. That implies it has the author's name and a succinct description/"takeaway" after the link. 
  - **The entry format** should follow this model: `[The Title of Your Article](link) - by author. Takeaway: ...`
  - Use a **-** to separate the link and description.
- Takeaways should avoid sub-bullets and be complete sentences. 
- Use **quotation marks** when you're quoting verbatim.
- Make **one individual pull request per each new entry/suggestion**.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style), regardless of the style used by the original article.
- Add link additions in **alphabetical order**. 
  - Disregard articles (**the/an/a**) coming at the beginning of titles and use the next word.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
